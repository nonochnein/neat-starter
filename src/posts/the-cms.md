The Netlify CMS seems simple. Simple enough to use, and just simple overall. Nothing frilling, nothing thrilling. I appreciate that, to be honest. I've had my share of clunky editors and CMS to be able to appreciate something like this.

Of course, being no-frills, it means the things have to be managed a lot more on the template side than on the CMS. But I guess that's actually par for course for headless CMSes, given that they are agnostic to the generator and platform used.

Just for a test, here's a picture to add:

One thing I did find a little unwieldy is the _tags_ component of the post editor. I can't not have tags, which is odd given that the default sample posts are tagless. But I guess that comes with original-template-creator privilege --- you can jump through restrictions like this. Also, I can't actually create custom tags, and can only select what's available, as far as I know. Typing in something new doesn't stick. So I'm left to just select any tag that is available. I chose `config.yml` as the tag.  I don't even know why that is a tag in the first place.
