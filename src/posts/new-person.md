Sirjith has created this excellent template, and I've taken over the management of this blog. Currently using Netlify CMS, with Eleventy as the underlying static site generator. I've put off using 11ty because I was using Hugo at that time. However, since changing to a new computer, and having not installed anything, I thought I might as well give 11ty a try. 

It looks like it's written in JS, so customising certain things would probably be easier for me, as compared to handling GO and the GO templating language that Hugo uses.
