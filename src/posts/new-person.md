Sirjith has created this excellent template, and I've taken over the management of this blog. Currently using Netlify CMS, with Eleventy as the underlying static site generator. I've put off using 11ty because I was using Hugo at that time. However, since changing to a new computer, and having not installed anything, I thought I might as well give 11ty a try. 

It looks like it's written in JS, so customising certain things would probably be easier for me, as compared to handling GO and the GO templating language that Hugo uses. While GO looks to be a very fast language, it is still not something I'm entirely familiar with. Besides... the last time I didn't anything using Hugo was perhaps when 2020 began. I think.

Somehow... getting things to update and be reflected accordingly is not as direct as I want. I had assumed cache invalidation (or something) would accomplish that, but pages don't always reflect the changes even if I do a hard refresh.

Now, the updates seem to be delayed by one version. So, the changes I made prior to my last paragraph from above only showed up when said last paragraph was created and saved.
